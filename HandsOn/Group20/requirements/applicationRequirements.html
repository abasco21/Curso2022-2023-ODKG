        <p>
            We will develop a data driven research tool focused on different private collaborative  entities registered in Madrid City Council records. Users 
            will be able to  make queries based on some of  the following  criteria: by name, by the  kind of entity  the selected ones are, by the  location
            of its headquarters, by the geographical area in which they act, trough the  existing relationships  between them, by the social topic the entity 
            covers or by its number of  affiliates, among  others. Moreover,  users will  be able to obtain  some useful information associated  with queried 
            entities, as adress, phone, email, website, register date or CIF code.  
        </p>

            We will show locations of all different entities in a map. The number of entities displayed on it will vary as filters are applied. Clicking on an 
            entity locator, relevant information regarding it will be indicated.
